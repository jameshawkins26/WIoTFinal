# Group 2 Final Project - James Hawkins, Alexis Mann, Jess Saviano

The challenge that our project is addressing is creating a system where it allows users to scan an NFC tag to connect to a WiFi network. We imagined this in a coffee shop where a user would be given an NFC tag embedded in a coaster when they purchased an item from the shop. It could also be used to solve the issue of connecting to the UVA hidden network, “wahoo.” It allows the network to still be hidden but the user can tap the device to connect rather than having to visit a website and entering all of their information. They could then scan the tag to register their MAC address in the WiFi network. This system would be an improvement upon the current system which is in many cases coffee shops writing or printing their WiFi network and password on paper and displayed in the shop. Our system will improve the former through preventing an overcrowding network, promoting their business through only allowing paying customers to use their network, and also make it an easier experience for the customer to connect to the WiFi network as they will no longer have to worry about mistyping passwords. In order to approach this new system, we developed a prototype in which an NFC tag is created with two records. One of which is a randomly generated number which mimics the user’s MAC address. The other of which is a url which goes to a web page that allows the user to input the randomly generated number found from the NFC tag. Once the peripheral with the NFC tag is flashed, it advertises the randomly generated number to the central device which mimics the WiFi network. Now that the user has the randomly generated number and so does the central device, the user would then enter their number into the web page as a verification step and to mimic adding their MAC address to the network.
